      HOMEWORK INSTRUCTIONS

      1. READ THE DIRECTIONS CAREFULLY.

      2a. Change "yourPawprint" in the file name to be your
            actual pawprint

      2b. Load the file into ghci on your local machine
            or online at repl.it using
              ":l <yourfilename>.hs"

      3. Work your way down the document, filling in
            code or type signatures where specified.

            You MAY NOT alter type signatures if already
            present. You MAY NOT change the names of the
            functions specified, these will be used for
            automated testing and must achieve the behavior
            specified.

            You MAY write helper functions to assist in
            the logic of your functions.

      4. There are 4 parts to this assignment. As they progress, they will
              progress in difficulty, while building on eachother. It is
              recommended that you use the hints in the comments, along
              with the code from lecture to solve the problems given.

           5A. Part I   - Types     (20 pts)
           5B. Part II  - Lists     (20 pts)
           5C. Part III - Functions (10 pts)
                        - Total     (50 pts)
           5D. Part IV  - Bonus     (5  pts)

      EVALUATION CRITERIA

      1. You will be evaluated using automated tests
        that compare your answers to randomly generated
        values that pass tests I write.

      2. Your code must type check. That is, no errors
        can be thrown when I load your file into ghc.
        It is better to define a function as undefined
        than to let it ruin the compiliation.

      3. You will receive +1 point for an attempt that does
          not break the compiler, but is not correct.
         You will receive other partial credit if specified.
         You will receive 0 points for an undefined function.
         You will receive +1 point for a correct type signature
          even if you leave the function undefined. (If you were
          prompted to fill in the type signature)

      4. The point values of each function are specified directly
            above the functions themselves.

      5. Cheating is not tolerated. Refrain from copying code from eachother,
            but feel free to use the internet as a resource. If you feel the
            need to directly copy someone's code, please cite it in comments
            using "--" to start a line comment.
